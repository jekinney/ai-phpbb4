# Personal Message Ban System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
A comprehensive PM ban system has been implemented to allow administrators to restrict users from sending and receiving personal messages. This system includes both temporary and permanent ban capabilities with full administrative interface.

## Database Changes
**Migration:** `2025_07_28_021633_add_pm_ban_fields_to_users_table.php`

Added fields to `users` table:
- `is_pm_banned` (boolean) - Flag indicating if user is PM banned
- `pm_banned_at` (timestamp) - When the ban was applied
- `pm_ban_reason` (text) - Reason for the ban
- `pm_banned_by` (foreign key) - ID of admin who applied the ban
- `pm_ban_expires_at` (timestamp) - When the ban expires (null = permanent)

## User Model Enhancements
**File:** `app/Models/User.php`

### New Methods:
- `isPmBanned()` - Check if user is currently PM banned (includes expiration logic)
- `canSendMessages()` - Check if user can send PMs (combines permission + ban check)
- `canReceiveMessages()` - Check if user can receive PMs  
- `pmBan(User $bannedBy, string $reason, $expiresAt = null)` - Apply PM ban
- `removePmBan()` - Remove PM ban
- `getPmBanInfo()` - Get ban details for display

### Features:
- Automatic expiration handling (expired bans are treated as not banned)
- Supports both temporary and permanent bans
- Tracks who applied the ban and when
- Provides detailed ban information for UI display

## Permission System Updates
**File:** `config/acl.php`

Added new permissions:
- `ban_from_messages` - Ability to ban users from PM system
- `manage_pm_bans` - Administrative access to PM ban management interface

## Administrative Interface
**Component:** `app/Livewire/Admin/PmBanManagement.php`
**View:** `resources/views/livewire/admin/pm-ban-management.blade.php`
**Route:** `/admin/pm-bans`

### Features:
- **User Search:** Real-time search through all users
- **Ban Status Display:** Clear indicators for banned/unbanned users
- **Ban Management:**
  - Apply temporary bans (with expiration date/time)
  - Apply permanent bans
  - Remove existing bans
- **Ban Details:** Display reason, who banned, when expires
- **Responsive UI:** Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Toast Notifications:** Success/error feedback
- **Pagination:** Handles large user lists efficiently

### Admin Interface Components:
- Search bar with live filtering
- User list with ban status indicators
- Modal forms for ban/unban actions
- Date/time picker for temporary bans
- Reason text area for ban justification

## User Interface Updates

### Compose Message Page
**File:** `resources/views/livewire/messages/compose.blade.php`
- Shows prominent warning banner for banned users
- Displays ban reason and expiration date
- Prevents form submission when banned
- Provides clear navigation back to inbox

### Message Inbox
**File:** `resources/views/livewire/messages/inbox.blade.php`
- Hides compose buttons for banned users
- Shows "Messaging Restricted" indicator instead
- Prevents access to compose functionality

### Message Replies
**Files:** 
- `app/Livewire/Messages/Show.php`
- `resources/views/livewire/messages/show.blade.php`
- Updated `canReply` property to check PM ban status
- Prevents reply functionality for banned users
- Added PM ban checks to `sendReply()` method

### Message Composition
**File:** `app/Livewire/Messages/Compose.php`
- PM ban checks in `mount()` method with redirect
- PM ban validation in `send()` method
- Clear error messages for banned users
- Prevents message sending when banned

## Security Features
- **Double-checking:** PM ban status verified at multiple points (UI, component mount, send methods)
- **Permission Integration:** Works with existing ACL permission system
- **Automatic Expiration:** Temporary bans automatically lift when expired
- **Audit Trail:** Tracks who applied bans and when
- **Clean UI:** Banned users see clear messaging instead of broken functionality

## Testing
**Command:** `php artisan test:pm-ban`

Comprehensive test covering:
- Initial user state (can send/receive)
- Temporary ban application and verification
- Ban removal and restoration of privileges
- Permanent ban application
- Final cleanup and verification

## Usage Examples

### For Administrators:
1. Access `/admin/pm-bans` (requires `manage_pm_bans` permission)
2. Search for user by name
3. Click "Ban" to open ban modal
4. Choose temporary (with expiration) or permanent ban
5. Provide ban reason
6. Submit to apply ban

### For Banned Users:
- Cannot access compose page (redirected with flash message)
- Cannot see compose buttons in inbox (shows "Messaging Restricted")
- Cannot reply to existing messages (reply functionality hidden)
- See clear ban information with reason and expiration

## Integration Points
- **ACL System:** Uses existing permission framework
- **Toast Notifications:** Integrates with site-wide notification system
- **Livewire Components:** Follows established component patterns
- **Responsive Design:** Matches site's Tailwind CSS design system
- **Database:** Uses Laravel migrations and Eloquent relationships

## Future Enhancements

- Bulk ban operations for multiple users
- Ban appeal system
- Integration with general user ban system
- Ban history logging
- Auto-ban based on user reports
