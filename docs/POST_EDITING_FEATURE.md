# Post Editing and Deletion Feature

## Overview
This feature allows users to edit and delete their own posts in forum topics with proper permission controls and user-friendly interfaces.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ **Inline Post Editing**
- **Real-time editing**: Users can edit posts directly in the topic view without page reload
- **Permission-based**: Users can only edit their own posts (or all posts if they have admin permissions)
- **Edit tracking**: All edits are timestamped and tracked with the editor's information
- **Content validation**: Ensures posts meet minimum/maximum length requirements
- **Cancel functionality**: Users can cancel edits and revert to original content

### ✅ **Post Deletion**
- **Secure deletion**: Users can delete their own posts with confirmation
- **First post protection**: The first post of a topic cannot be deleted (must delete entire topic)
- **Permission-based**: Follows ACL permissions (delete_own_posts, delete_all_posts)
- **Confirmation dialog**: JavaScript confirmation prevents accidental deletions
- **Real-time removal**: Deleted posts are immediately removed from the topic view

### ✅ **User Experience Enhancements**
- **Toast notifications**: Success/error messages appear as non-intrusive toast notifications
- **Loading states**: Visual feedback during save/delete operations
- **Responsive design**: Works properly on desktop and mobile devices
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support

## Technical Implementation

### **Models & Relationships**
- **Post Model**: Enhanced with editing methods and relationships
- **User tracking**: `created_by`, `updated_by`, `edited_at`, `edited_by` fields
- **Content processing**: Automatic HTML generation from plain text

### **Authorization System**
- **PostPolicy**: Controls who can edit/delete posts
- **ACL Integration**: Uses existing permission system
- **Role-based access**: Members, moderators, and administrators have different levels of access

### **Livewire Components**
- **PostEdit**: Main component handling inline editing and deletion
- **ToastNotification**: Provides user feedback for actions
- **TopicShow**: Updated to use new post editing components

### **Permissions Used**
- `edit_own_posts` - Edit own posts
- `edit_all_posts` - Edit any post (moderator/admin)
- `delete_own_posts` - Delete own posts

## Security Features

### **Performance Optimizations**

- **Database indexing**: Optimize queries for large topics

## Testing

### **Test Coverage**

- Feature tests for edit/delete workflows
- Permission testing for authorization
- UI tests for proper rendering

### **Test Commands**
```bash
php artisan test --filter=PostEditTest
php artisan test --filter=PostPolicy
```

## Configuration

### **Environment Variables**
- No additional environment variables needed
- Uses existing database and permission configurations

### **Permissions Setup**
Permissions are automatically configured in `config/acl.php`:
- Members get: `edit_own_posts`, `delete_own_posts`
- Moderators get: `edit_all_posts`, `delete_own_posts`
- Administrators get: All post permissions

## Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**
1. **"Cannot edit post"**: Check user permissions and post ownership
2. **"Cannot delete first post"**: This is intentional - delete the topic instead
3. **Toast not showing**: Ensure AlpineJS is loaded and ToastNotification component is included

### **Debug Tips**
- Check Laravel logs for authorization errors
- Use browser dev tools to inspect Livewire events
- Verify database permissions and foreign keys

This feature provides a complete, secure, and user-friendly post editing and deletion system that integrates seamlessly with the existing forum infrastructure.
